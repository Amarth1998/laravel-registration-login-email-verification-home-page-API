In Laravel, after a user registers, an email verification link is sent to their email. When the user tries to log in before verifying, they will see a message saying, "Please verify your email." Until the email is verified, the user cannot access the home page or other restricted areas. Once the user clicks the verification link and their email is confirmed, they can log in and access the full functionality of the application. This ensures that only verified users can proceed beyond the login page, adding an extra layer of security and reliability to the application.
